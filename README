metastudent 2.0

Metastudent predicts GO terms for given amino acid sequences by joining the predictions of various individual classifiers, e.g. based on BLAST
Metastudent predicts gene ontology (GO) terms for protein sequences through homology. It first runs a BLAST query for a given target against a custom BLAST database containing sequences and GO terms of previously annotated proteins. If a similar sequence is found, the output is used by three different base classifiers to calculate three separate sets of GO terms. Finally, a smart meta classifier converts them into one set. If there is no similar sequence in the BLAST database, no prediction is made.
