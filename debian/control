Description: predictor of gene ontology terms from protein sequence
 Metastudent predicts gene ontology (GO) terms for protein sequences 
 through homology. It first runs a single BLAST query for all targets
 against a custom BLAST database. This database contains sequences and 
 GO terms of previously annotated proteins.
 .
 The output is then used by three different base classifiers. They 
 calculate three separate sets of GO terms. Finally, a meta classifier 
 converts the three sets into one.
