Description: predictor of gene ontology terms from protein sequence
 Metastudent predicts gene ontology (GO) terms for protein sequences through
 homology inference from already annotated proteins.
 .
 As a first step, it runs a single BLAST query for all targets against a custom BLAST database. 
 The output is then used by three different base classifiers to calculate three separate 
 sets of GO terms. A meta classifier finally converts the three sets into one comprehensive output for each ontology.
