Description: predictor of Gene Ontology terms from protein sequence
 Metastudent predicts Gene Ontology (GO) terms for protein sequences 
 through homology.
 .
 For every sequence in the input FASTA file, GO terms with
 reliability scores are output.
 .
 metastudent first runs a single BLAST query for all targets
 against a custom BLAST database. This database contains sequences and 
 GO terms of previously annotated proteins.
 The output is then used by three different base classifiers. They 
 calculate three separate sets of GO terms. Finally, a meta classifier 
 converts the three sets into one.
